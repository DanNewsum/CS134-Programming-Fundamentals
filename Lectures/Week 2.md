# Tuesday

## Review: CodePad Lab 1

* For each line of code, what was the result, and why?


## Review: Variables and Data Types

**Data Types**

* What data type stores the value **true** or **false**?
* What data type(s) stores numbers with decimal points in them?
* What data type stores whole numbers - no decimals?

**Variables**

* In order to **declare** a variable, you need what two items (at minimum)?
* Initializing a variable means...?
* When wanting to store the result of some math calculation in a variable, which side of the equal sign =
    does the math equation go on?


## Software Development Applications & Careers

What kind of careers are there, that relate to programming and tech?

**Computer Science Field Guide:**

* [Software Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNMbEbz2dys)
* [Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE2u5trQAHM)
* [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia-oYtacJHE)
* [Computer Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kuoRjgfCls)

Many fields intersect with programming, so no matter what your interests are,
you can probably find an application for programming with it.

**Any suggestions?**

Make sure to answer the discussion questions in D2L:

* Real-world Applications


## Programming Terminology

Here are some definitions from Wikipedia, but let's redefine
these in our own words...

### Source Code

> In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, (possibly with comments), written using a human-readable computer language, usually as ordinary text.

([Source code / Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code))

Hacking?
Instructions
Text

### Compile / Compilation

> A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code.[1] The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.

([Compiler / Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler))

Converts source code into executable (.exe) files

### Object Oriented Programming

> In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.

([Object-oriented programming / Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming))

### Object

> In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, or a function or a method, and as such, is a location in memory having a value and possibly referenced by an identifier.

> In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, "object" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.

([Object (computer science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_%28computer_science%29))

### Class

> In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

([Class (computer programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29))

### Methods / Functions

> A method (or message) in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with an object.

([Method (computer programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_%28computer_programming%29))

* Classes/Objects - Contain variables and functions
* Methods/Functions - Sets of code, several statements
* Variables
