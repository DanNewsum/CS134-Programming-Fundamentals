# Setting Up

When you first open up Greenfoot, it might be empty, or it might open 
up with a project already loaded (usually the last project opened).
Make sure you **create a new project** through **Scenario > New Java Scenario...**
(Note, with older versions, this might just be "New Scenario").

To create a project, you need to create a new folder first.
Create a new folder anywhere on your computer (it must be empty),
navigate into it, then click **Create** to create the project.

Once your project is created, you will have a blank canvas, and
nothing listed under **World** or **Actor** (right-hand side)
